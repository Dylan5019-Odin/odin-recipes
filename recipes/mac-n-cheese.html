<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  Baked mac and cheese. It’s nearly the universal comfort food, and there are SO
  many variations! In fact, I almost didn’t post this recipe, as there are SOOOO
  many mac and cheese recipes available, and most people already have their
  favorite way of making it.
</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>1 lb. dried elbow pasta</li>
  <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter</li>
  <li>1/2 cup all purpose flour</li>
  <li>1 1/2 cups whole milk</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <h3>Step 1</h3>
  <li>
    Preheat oven to 325 degrees F and grease a 3 qt baking dish (9x13"). Set
    aside.
  </li>
  <h3>Step 2</h3>
  <li>
    Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. When boiling, add dried pasta
    and cook 1 minute less than the package directs for al dente. Drain and
    drizzle with a little bit of olive oil to keep from sticking.
  </li>
</ol>
